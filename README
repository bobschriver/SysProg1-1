***NOTE***
This project will not build without the allocate routines, which was supplied by the professor.

This project is meant to demonstrate a library database, with patrons storing references to 
all of the books they have checked out, and all of the books storing references to the 
patrons who are checking them out. The program had other constraints, like restricting
the amount of memory we would need to get extra credit points on the assignment.
